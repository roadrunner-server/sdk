# v2.5.0 (20.10.2021)

# 💔 Breaking change:

- 🔨 Some drivers now use a new `config` key to handle local configuration. Involved plugins and drivers:
- `plugins`: `broadcast`, `kv`
- `drivers`: `memory`, `redis`, `memcached`, `boltdb`.

### Old style:

```yaml
broadcast:
  default:
    driver: memory
    interval: 1
```

### New style:

```yaml
broadcast:
  default:
    driver: memory
      config: { } <--------------- NEW
```

```yaml
kv:
  memory-rr:
    driver: memory
    config: <--------------- NEW
      interval: 1

kv:
  memcached-rr:
    driver: memcached
    config: <--------------- NEW
      addr:
        - "127.0.0.1:11211"

broadcast:
  default:
    driver: redis
    config: <------------------ NEW
      addrs:
        - "127.0.0.1:6379"
```

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ **[BETA]** GRPC plugin update to v2.
- ✏️ [Roadrunner-plugins](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/sdk-plugins) repository. This is the new home for the
  roadrunner plugins with documentation, configuration samples, and common problems.
- ✏️ **[BETA]** Let's Encrypt support. RR now can obtain an SSL certificate/PK for your domain automatically. Here is
  the new configuration:

```yaml
    ssl:
      # Host and port to listen on (eg.: `127.0.0.1:443`).
      #
      # Default: ":443"
      address: "127.0.0.1:443"

      # Use ACME certificates provider (Let's encrypt)
      acme:
        # Directory to use as a certificate/pk, account info storage
        #
        # Optional. Default: rr_cache
        certs_dir: rr_le_certs

        # User email
        #
        # Used to create LE account. Mandatory. Error on empty.
        email: you-email-here@email

        # Alternate port for the http challenge. Challenge traffic should be redirected to this port if overridden.
        #
        # Optional. Default: 80
        alt_http_port: 80,


        # Alternate port for the tls-alpn-01 challenge. Challenge traffic should be redirected to this port if overridden.
        #
        # Optional. Default: 443.
        alt_tlsalpn_port: 443,

        # Challenge types
        #
        # Optional. Default: http-01. Possible values: http-01, tlsalpn-01
        challenge_type: http-01

        # Use production or staging endpoints. NOTE, try to use the staging endpoint (`use_production_endpoint`: `false`) to make sure, that everything works correctly.
        #
        # Optional, but for production should be set to true. Default: false
        use_production_endpoint: true

        # List of your domains to obtain certificates
        #
        # Mandatory. Error on empty.
        domains: [
            "your-cool-domain.here",
            "your-second-domain.here"
        ]
```

- ✏️ Add a new option to the `logs` plugin to configure the line ending. By default, used `\n`.

**New option**:

```yaml
# Logs plugin settings
logs:
  (....)
  # Line ending
  #
  # Default: "\n".
  line_ending: "\n"
```

- ✏️ HTTP [Access log support](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/34) at the `Info` log level.

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:55555
  max_request_size: 1024
  access_logs: true <-------- Access Logs ON/OFF
  middleware: [ ]

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ✏️ HTTP middleware to handle `X-Sendfile` [header](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/9). Middleware
  reads the file in 10MB chunks. So, for example for the 5Gb file, only 10MB of RSS will be used. If the file size is
  smaller than 10MB, the middleware fits the buffer to the file size.

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:44444
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: [ "sendfile" ] <----- NEW MIDDLEWARE

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ✏️ Service plugin now supports env variables passing to the script/executable/binary/any like in the `server` plugin:

```yaml
service:
  some_service_1:
    command: "php test_files/loop_env.php"
    process_num: 1
    exec_timeout: 5s # s,m,h (seconds, minutes, hours)
    remain_after_exit: true
    env: <----------------- NEW
      foo: "BAR"
    restart_sec: 1
```

- ✏️ Server plugin can accept scripts (sh, bash, etc) in it's `command` configuration key:

```yaml
server:
  command: "./script.sh OR sh script.sh" <--- UPDATED
  relay: "pipes"
  relay_timeout: "20s"
```

The script should start a worker as the last command. For the `pipes`, scripts should not contain programs, which can
close `stdin`, `stdout` or `stderr`.

- ✏️ Nats jobs driver support - [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/pull/68).

```yaml
nats:
  addr: "demo.nats.io"

jobs:
  num_pollers: 10
  pipeline_size: 100000
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s

  pipelines:
    test-1:
      driver: nats
      prefetch: 100
      subject: "default"
      stream: "foo"
      deliver_new: "true"
      rate_limit: 100
      delete_stream_on_stop: false
      delete_after_ack: false
      priority: 2

  consume: [ "test-1" ]
```

- Driver uses NATS JetStream API and is not compatible with non-js API.


- ✏️ Response API for the NATS, RabbitMQ, SQS and Beanstalk drivers. This means, that you'll be able to respond to a
  specified in the response queue. Limitations:
    - To send a response to the queue maintained by the RR, you should send it as a `Job` type. There are no limitations
      for the responses into the other queues (tubes, subjects).
    - Driver uses the same endpoint (address) to send the response as specified in the configuration.

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: local and global configuration parsing.
- 🐛 Fix: `boltdb-jobs` connection left open after RPC close command.
- 🐛 Fix: close `beanstalk` connection and release associated resources after pipeline stopped.
- 🐛 Fix: grpc plugin fails to handle requests after calling `reset`.
- 🐛 Fix: superfluous response.WriteHeader call when connection is broken.

  pipeline in the configuration.

## v2.4.0 (02.09.2021)

## 💔 Internal BC:

- 🔨 Pool, worker interfaces: payload now passed and returned by the pointer.

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ Long-awaited, reworked `Jobs` plugin with pluggable drivers. Now you can allocate/destroy pipelines in the runtime.
  Drivers included in the initial release: `RabbitMQ (0-9-1)`, `SQS v2`, `beanstalk`, `memory` and local queue powered
  by the `boltdb`. [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/pull/726)

- 🐛 Fix: remove `build` and other old targets from the Makefile.

---

## v2.2.0 (11.05.2021)

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ Reworked `static` plugin. Now, it does not affect the performance of the main route and persist on the separate
  file server (within the `http` plugin). Looong awaited feature: `Etag` (+ weak Etags) as well with the `If-Mach`
  , `If-None-Match`, `If-Range`, `Last-Modified`
  and `If-Modified-Since` tags supported. Static plugin has a bunch of new options such as: `allow`, `calculate_etag`
  , `weak` and `pattern`.

  ### Option `always` was deleted from the plugin.

- ✏️ Update `informer.List` implementation. Now it returns a list with the all available plugins in the runtime.

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: issue with wrong ordered middlewares (reverse). Now the order is correct.
- 🐛 Fix: issue when RR fails if a user sets `debug` mode with the `exec_ttl` supervisor option.

- ✏️ Add dotenv file support (`.env` in working directory by default; file location can be changed using CLI
  flag `--dotenv` or `DOTENV_PATH` environment variable) (thanks @tarampampam).
- 📜 Add a new `raw` mode for the `logger` plugin to keep the stderr log message of the worker unmodified (logger
  severity level should be at least `INFO`).
- 🆕 Add Readiness probe check. The `status` plugin provides `/ready` endpoint which return the `204` HTTP code if there
  are no workers in the `Ready` state and `200 OK` status if there are at least 1 worker in the `Ready` state.
